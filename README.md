# Wireless-Motor-Controller

In this project, we intend to build a wireless motor remote controller operating a bunch of 28BYJ48 stepper motors that will be used to control the motion (Opening/Closing) of flaps on a cosplay suit using the above-mentioned remote controller. 

The project will have two major design components, a handheld controller and four identical receiver boards, each equipped with MSP430G2553 mixed signal microcontrollers, an nRF24L01 transceiver and other essential circuit components like a voltage regulator, capacitors, resistors, copper foil and 3.6 V Li-ion Battery. 

The handheld controller consists of 2 switches, one push-button and 6 LEDâ€™s as its major functional and user interaction components. Same as the receiver board, the controller circuit board is also equipped with MSP430G2553 mixed signal microcontrollers, an nRF24L01 transceiver and other essential circuit components like a voltage regulator, capacitors, resistors and a 3.6 V Li-ion Battery. 

The functionality and purpose of all the above-mentioned components for both the controller and receiver are explained in the block diagram, schematics and battery analysis sections, respectively.
